# @tinnoland/ios-share-plugin

An updated fork from [expo-config-plugin-ios-share-extension](https://github.com/timedtext/expo-config-plugin-ios-share-extension)

An Expo config plugin to auto-configure `iOS Share Extension`

## Installation

Install it in your project:

```sh
npx expo install @tinnoland/ios-share-plugin
```

In your appâ€™s Expo config (app.json, or app.config.js), make sure that `@tinnoland/ios-share-plugin` has been added to the list of plugins.

```app.json
  "plugins": [
            [
                "@tinnoland/ios-share-plugin",
                {
                    "activationRules": {
                        "NSExtensionActivationSupportsText": false,
                        "NSExtensionActivationSupportsWebURLWithMaxCount": 1,
                        "NSExtensionActivationSupportsMovieWithMaxCount": 1
                    }
                }
            ],
  ]
```

Next, rebuild your app.

```
eas build --profile development --platform ios
```

## Known limitations

- Only support directly redirect to [Containing app](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Conceptual/ExtensibilityPG/ExtensionOverview.html).
  - [Here's an article](https://medium.com/kraaft-co/how-i-reached-the-limits-of-react-native-by-implementing-an-ios-share-extension-4f312b534f22) that explains why this approach was chosen.
